                    <p>Our understanding of domestic and non-domestic energy use and carbon emissions (and how we can improve our building to improve these) is 
key to Scotland’s transition to net zero by <a href=" https://www.gov.scot/policies/climate-change/reducing-emissions/" target = "blank">2045</a> and eliminating fuel poverty by <a href=”https://www.gov.scot/publications/tackling-fuel-poverty-scotland-strategic-approach/” target = “blank”> 2040</a>.

<p>In my role at Energy Saving Trust, I lead the development and analysis of the Scottish Government-funded Home Analytics Scotland dataset and Portfolio Energy Analysis Tool (PEAT) modelling platform. These tools are key to multiple Scottish strategies, policies and funding schemes. Play a pivotal role in helping plot out where we are, where we need to go and how we get there. 
I provide access to these tools for housing associations, national and local governments and collaborate closely with these groups to build data analysis capacity 
within organisations, enhance available datasets by feeding in their in-house expertise and datasets to Home Analytics and provide meaningful data insights through graphics, reports 
and presentations to help guide energy efficiency policy and strategy. Recently, this included supporting Perth and Kinross Council and Fife Council on their Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategies (LHEES) planning. 
All Scottish Local Authorities will be required to produce an <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/local-heat-energy-efficiency-strategies-lhees-phase-2-pilots-evaluation/" target="blank">LHEES</a> – i.e. a plan of action to systematically improve the energy efficiency of buildings and decarbonising heat in their region. Using my analysis and visualisation skills in R and Power BI analysed large datasets I baselined the current property 
stock of these areas to highlight the challenges and opportunity areas ahead, collaborated with the councils on how to best approach modelling potential policy scenarios and led the modelling of the chosen retrofit scenarios. 
I delivered to the councils various graphics and tables which outline a cost-benefit analysis for each potential retrofit strategy. I am currently exploring opportunities to further utilise software like Power BI to make these large datasets more accessible and provide more value to our users.</p>  

<p>In my first year I innovated multiple workflows and products using R and Power BI, established a strong, diverse and wide reaching network of stakeholders, 
continued to develop my analytical skillset (and my team's capacity in R and other tools with several workshop sessions) and exceeded my KPIs by an average of 78%.</p>

                    <p>Reconstructing past environmental change is useful to give us important insights in to our dynamic earth system and help us understand current and future environmental change. As part of my PhD at the <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/dges/research/quaternary/about/" target = "blank">Aberystwyth University Quaternary Environmental Change Research Group</a> I worked within the <a href = "https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb19/dfg2358" target = "blank">DFG-funded Bale Mountains Group</a>
composed of archaeologists, ecologists, geochemists and a broad range of palaeoscientists from across Europe and Ethiopia to reconstruct past environmental change and ecological resilience in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. 
We spent over a month camping at sites around the mountains (3,000-4,000 m altitude) digging trial pits, drilling sediments, sampling lake waters, streams and bogs for chemical and ecological analyses exposing me to a wide range of analytical techniques in laboratories across Europe.

<p>Alongside geochemical (X-ray fluorescence, organic isotopes and wet chemistry: ICP-MS, AAS and ion chromatography) and microscope (micro-algae identification; see below my work on identiying a new species: <a href="#section3"><i>Nitzschia fenestralis</i></a>) laboratory work 
I also taught myself R coding to effectively visualise and analyse these large datasets (>3 million points of data in several datasets). Adding to my expertise in understanding and analysing a range of data from my BSc and MSc studies, I am now experienced in writing and implementing 
my own code to analyse long, complicated time series (our core from one lake covered the <b><i>last 16,000 years</i></b>) and ecological community data to model and reconstruct environmental changes through time. I have worked with multiple packages for ordination, modelling and plotting of data including using methods new to the field such as general additive models, princpial curves and dynamic time warping</p>  

<p>This work in the Bale Mountains is still ongoing and being prepared for numerous reports and papers. However, below are links to our work that has been published work and a presentation of my PhD thesis data that I gave at the international INQUA Congress in 2019 (>2,300 attendees). Feel free to <a href="#section5">contact me</a> if you wish to discuss my environmental research and data/code further.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>My MSc gave me a broad exposure to important subjects for enviromnmental monitoring and management. Modules in my MSc built upon those of my BSc and further developed my scientific understanding of environmental change through practical sessions 
					(fieldwork, labwork and data analysis/modelling sessions) and lectures on a broad spectrum of climate change and environmental earth science. 
					This was complimented by modules on more human geography themes such as interpreting policy, environmental governance, the ideas of resilience, adaptability and the role of psychological and behavioural sciences in combating climate change. 
					I believe this has given me a well-rounded perspective on how we can combat climate change in a truly holistic way.
					I completed a range of different assignemnts from a hypothetical <a href="../PDF/Green_roof_white_paper.pdf" target = "blank">white paper</a> assessing viability of green roofing in Cardiff, Wales to a <a href="../PDF/BSC_report.pdf" target = "blank">report</a> reviewing current climate models and assessing the impacts of climate change on Spanish soil ecology. 
					
					<p>This blended perspective between physical and human geography is best illustrated by my choise of MSc thesis. 
					Flood data in Wales is quite limited before the 1970s. I identified this and after a small pilot study I succesfully pitched this research idea to my supervisors and potential partners at Natural Resources Wales (NRW). 
					I looked at past flood events, but also the impacts and responses of communities in Wales through time using
					the National Library of Wales <a href="https://newspapers.library.wales/" target = "blank"> digital newspaper archive</a>. 
					This was an ambitious project that I started alongside my second semester of taught modules to ensure I had the time to trawl through the >15 million articles available in the archive. <b>The hard work paid off!</b> 
					I transcribed around 1,500 articles and documented a total of 378 reported flood events between 1870 and 1900. 
					This work has extended NRW's database of flooding and its impacts to increase the resilience and adaptability of modern-day communities.  </p>

<p>The sources of information were so detailed that often I was able to also record the social, environmental and economic impacts of each flood. 
I used this data and worked with colleagues at NRW to also create an index to asses the severity of each flood based on the <i><b>extent</b></i> (area and amount of people directly impacted by a flood), 
<i><b>severity</b></i> (amount of damage and deaths casued)and <i><b>duration</b></i> (amount of time floodwaters and impacts remained). These index scores helped to visualise and understand this large dataset of flood events.</p>

<p>In fact, these accounts of flooding in Wales were so detailed in some cases that I used historical OS maps and reconstructed the extent of floodwaters and identified the exact business and individuals impacted by a flood in Cwmcarn (1875)
and in Bridgend (1877). These detailed stories of real people and businesses affected by past floods provided some useful, relatable narratives of flooding that give 
good insights in to how we can adapt to flooding, mitiagte it's impacts and respond effectively. This work received a high distinction grade and contributed to me receiving the <i>Outstanding Masters’ Award</i> for highest overall grades at Masters level in the University. 
My collaborators at Natural Resources Wales were very pleased with this database, this work has laid the foundations to further utilise this archive and is currently being prepared for publication.</p>

                    <p></p>
            <p>Around 50 km away from the hectic Addis Ababa in Ethiopia is the Bishoftu Crater Lakes. One of these lakes, surrounded by sunbathers on hotel balconies and populated by people practicing water sports, 
			was the second study area for my PhD research: Lake Babogaya. The sediments taken from Lake Babogaya were an important part of my research where I used diatoms to reconstruct past environmental change in the area 
			for the last 5,500 years.</p> 
			
			<p>Diatoms (<i>micro-algae the width of a human hair</i>) have a short life-cycle, colonise multiple habitats in water-bodies and are very sensitive to changes in the environment. 
			They have silica shells and so their fossils are preserved at the bottom of the lake giving us a way to infer past environmental conditions. 
			I taught myself how to identify diatoms at my African study sites as well as practicing on samples I took from some nearby Welsh sites. 
			Although it is a difficult skill to get the hang of (you often rely on old books with illustrations of species for comparison and long paragraphs of their size and key features) I made good progress in identifying diatoms. 
			But, shortly into my PhD, I realised I was going to have to count tons of the trickiest taxa a diatomist could encounter in natural samples – <i>Nitzschia</i>.</p>   
					
			<p><i>Nitzschia</i> Hassall is a widely distributed, diverse genus of diatoms. The size of the genus (around <b>2,800</b> different species, forms and varieties are listed on 
			<a href="http://www.diatombase.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=149045&allchildren=1" target="blank">DiatomBase</a>) and the close similarity in species characteristics makes them hard to 
			identify accurately under a light microscope (LM), you often need a more sophisticated scanning electron microscope (SEM) to gain highly detailed views of these diatoms to begin to really tell them apart. 
			In the Lake Babogaya core record, <i>Nitzschia</i> made up <b>80-100% of the 53,300 diatoms</b> that I identified! Most were identifable after some effort studying multiple sources and measuring hundreds of diatoms.
			But there was one diatom that was very common in my samples (>60% of some samples) that I couldn't quite pin to an already known and described species.</p> 
			
			<p>After I took detailed measurements, pictures, comparison with other species and notes of this mysterious diatom I reached out to experts at the 
			<a href="https://www.rbge.org.uk/science-and-conservation/herbarium/our-collections/algae/" target="blank"> Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh</a>. After securing research grant money I travelled with my samples to Edinburgh 
			to work with them and describe this new species in detail. With the facilities in Edinburgh it was possible to examine these diatoms at &#60;1 μm with SEM. A rather useful (and pretty) 
			feature I noticed was a feature that looked divided like small sash windows which led me to name this new species <i>Nitzschia fenestralis</i> which means “with little windows” in Latin.</p>
